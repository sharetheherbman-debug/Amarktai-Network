3. **Audio Recording UI** — No browser-based audio capture component
4. **Streaming Responses** — TTS returns full buffer, not streaming chunks
5. **Load Testing** — No load test scripts

### ⚠️ PARTIAL / NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

1. **App Profiles in DB** — Profiles stored in TypeScript Map, not Prisma tables
2. **Self-Healing Actions** — Detects issues but doesn't auto-remediate all categories

### ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED (Previously "Not Addressed")

1. **SSML / Affective Voice Output** — `ssml-voice.ts`: Emotion-to-SSML prosody mapping for Gemini (native SSML), voice/speed overrides for OpenAI/Groq. Integrated into `/api/brain/tts` via `emotionAware` flag.
2. **Realtime Voice WebSocket Container** — Added to `docker-compose.yml` as `realtime` service (port 8765), with Dockerfile, health checks, and `REALTIME_SERVICE_URL` wired to the app.
3. **Per-request Audit Trail / Output Scanning / Fallback Moderation** — `moderation-pipeline.ts`: Every content scan (input + output) records an immutable audit entry. Fallback chain: OpenAI Moderation API → keyword scanner → guardrails engine. Wired into Brain request route.
4. **First-run Onboarding Wizard** — `onboarding.ts` + `/api/admin/onboarding` endpoint: 4-step detection (admin account → provider → first app → health check) with progress percentage and next-step routing.
5. **OpenAI Moderation API** — Now fully integrated as primary classifier in `scanContentWithModeration()`, with keyword fallback. Used by moderation pipeline.
