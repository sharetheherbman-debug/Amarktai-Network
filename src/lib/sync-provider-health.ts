 *
 * Both the models route and the routing route need this operation before they
 * can report accurate `getUsableModels()` results.  Keeping it in one place
 * ensures both routes use identical logic and that any future DB schema
 * changes only need to be reflected here.

 * Syncs the in-process provider health cache from the `AiProvider` rows in
 * the database.  Providers that have an `apiKey` set are marked with their
 * current `healthStatus`; all others are marked `'unconfigured'` so that
 * `getUsableModels()` / `isProviderUsable()` return accurate results for
 * this request.
 *
 * Errors are logged but swallowed — callers fall through with whatever
 * health state was already cached (typically empty on first call, meaning
 * all providers are treated as usable, which is the safe default for a
 * cold-start with no DB).
